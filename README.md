# Hearthstone-Ladder-Simulation-iPython-Notebook

Hearthstone is an online card game for PC and phones. In Hearthstone, players compete on a ranked ladder system, 
starting at rank 25, and ending at 1. To advance to the next rank, a player must win a certain number of stars. 
Each win gains the player a star, and each loss removes a star. Win streaks give bonus stars below rank 5.
The goal of Hearthstone is to climb from rank 25 to 1, and ascend into the "Legend" rank.


This iPython notebook is a Monte Carlo simulation for predicting the number of games to reach Legend in Hearthstone, 
for a given win rate. This notebook visualizes a particular run through the ranking system as stars vs. games played. 
Additionally, this notebook visualizes the distrobution of number of wins to reach legend for a given win rate.
